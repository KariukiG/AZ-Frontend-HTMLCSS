  <h1>My HTML page</h1>
  <p>This is my study in <mark>Version Control</mark> .This is
     a practice done by Software Engineers and it is a very important skill.
    Without it one may never find any meaningful software development jobs.

  </p>
  <p>I have embarked in studying<u> Software Engineering</u> out 
    of curiosity and need to change career .<b>It comes at time I came across AzubiAfrica
     Organisation that is offering this bootcamp</b>.
     I plan to become a  <i>seasoned engineer</i> in the
      next few years and possess mostly highly sought skills therefore
       increasing and becoming of high value.  </p>
